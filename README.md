# Dementia Prediction Project - Readme

## Introduction
This readme documents my project on predicting dementia progression using Support Vector Machine (SVM) models on brain MRI features. It outlines the project's purpose, dataset, methodology, results, and future scope for improvements.

## Usage
This project is designed for individuals interested in healthcare analytics and machine learning applications in medical diagnosis. The code can serve as a foundation for understanding SVM models and their application in dementia prediction using MRI data.

## Documentation
The complete code for this project is available in the associated Jupyter notebook.
Additional documentation and resources on SVM models, dementia diagnosis, and MRI feature extraction can be found online.

## Problem Statement
The project aims to predict dementia progression based on brain MRI features. Early detection of dementia is crucial for timely intervention and treatment planning.

## Learning Objectives
By working on this project, you will:

- Explore MRI data and preprocess it for machine learning.
- Implement Support Vector Machine (SVM) models for multi-class classification.
- Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the OASIS longitudinal brain MRI dataset, which includes MRI scans from individuals with different dementia statuses. The dataset provides features such as age, gender, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, and brain volume measurements.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Explore and preprocess the MRI data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. **Model Training:** Implement SVM models with a linear kernel and evaluate their performance on predicting dementia progression.
3. **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.
4. **Future Scope:** Identify potential areas for model enhancement, including exploring nonlinear kernels, optimizing hyperparameters, and integrating advanced feature engineering techniques.

## Results
The project achieved promising results with SVM models (89.47%), demonstrating the feasibility of using MRI data for dementia prediction. However, further optimization and refinement are necessary to enhance model accuracy and generalization.

## Future Improvements
- Explore the impact of different kernel functions (e.g., polynomial, RBF) on model performance.
- Optimize hyperparameters such as C and gamma to improve model generalization.
- Investigate ensemble learning techniques and advanced feature engineering methods for enhanced predictive power.
- Collaborate with healthcare professionals for clinical validation and integration of the predictive model into healthcare systems.
